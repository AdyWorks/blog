I am a researcher and computer scientist. I was once in San Francisco, but am now traveling.

**Note**: Things may be a bit of a mess here while I de-jekyll all the previous posts. This may all go away if I find that jekyll actually did something valuable for me, but at this point I wouldn't worry about that.

#### [Epic Graph Battle of History: Chaos vs Order](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-08-20.md)

A reader wrote in about the "Sorting out graph processing" post, with some questions about how well sorting works when compared against the newest as-yet-unpublished (but SOSP 2015 bound!) systems research on how best to process graphs. I didn't know the answer, but I set out to discover it!

The perf numbers for the system itself are not yet in (my contact is PDT), but I'll update with them as they flow in.

We revisit the conventional wisdom that sorting is expensive, and random access is fast. In particular, if you think you might need to do a bunch of random accesses, maybe you should consider sorting the requests first. We look at some results in a paper from SOSP 2013 and see how speedy sorting algorithms likely change the trade-offs the paper proposes.

Also, differential dataflow goes a lot faster as a result of this stuff, so you should read about it.

#### [The impact of fast networks on graph analytics, part 2.](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-07-31.md)

Malte and I did a bit deeper into the sources of the performance discrepancies between GraphX and Timely dataflow. We measure many things, and work through some neat time series that look like

#### [The impact of fast networks on graph analytics, part 1.](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-07-08.md)

Malte Schwarzkopf and I look in to the question of to what degree does improving networking help in graph computation. We do some measurement, comparing a PageRank implementation in both GraphX and in Timely dataflow.

Prompted by reader questions, we take a light tour through some of the things that differential dataflow can do.
