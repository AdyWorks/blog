I am a researcher and computer scientist. I was once in San Francisco, but am now traveling.

**Note**: Things may be a bit of a mess here while I de-jekyll all the previous posts. This may all go away if I find that jekyll actually did something valuable for me, but at this point I wouldn't worry about that.

#### [Sorting out graph layout](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-08-15.md)

We look at a paper from SOSP 2013, which says that perhaps you shouldn't bother sorting graph edge data, and instead should just process it in whatever order you receive it. I reach a different conclusion.

#### [The impact of fast networks on graph analytics, part 2.](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-07-31.md)

Malte and I did a bit deeper into the sources of the performance discrepancies between GraphX and Timely dataflow. We measure many things, and work through some neat time series that look like

#### [The impact of fast networks on graph analytics, part 1.](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-07-08.md)

Malte Schwarzkopf and I look in to the question of to what degree does improving networking help in graph computation. We do some measurement, comparing a PageRank implementation in both GraphX and in Timely dataflow.

#### [Differential graph computation](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-05-12.md)

Prompted by reader questions, we take a light tour through some of the things that differential dataflow can do.
