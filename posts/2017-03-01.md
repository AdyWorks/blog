## High resolution, high throughput

This post is about the second of two issues I outlined a while back in a [differential dataflow roadmap](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-07-26.md). I've recently written a bit about the first issue, [performance degradation over time](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2017-02-11.md), and steps to ameliorate the issue. That seems to be mostly working now, and I'll write a bit more about that as it settles.

Instead, we'll talk in this post about the second concern: with fine-grained updates, perhaps just a few updates per timestamp, additional workers do not increase the throughput of update processing (and they mostly slow it down). 

Stealing [a figure from the roadmap post](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-07-26.md#resolution-and-scaling), let's look at doing 10,000 updates to a reachability computation with two million edges, but batching the 10,000 updates three different ways: one, ten, and one hundred updates at a time:

![batching](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/roadmap/batching.png)

The solid lines are the distributions of single-worker latencies, and the dotted lines are the distributions of two-worker latencies. Visually, the second worker helps when we have larger input batches and hurts when we have smaller input batches. In fact, the second worker helps enough on the tail (up at the top of the plot) that it always gives a throughput increase, but this seems like good luck more than anything. We would like to see curves that look more like the rightmost pair.

We would love to get the throughput scaling of larger batch sizes, so why not always work with large batch sizes? The single-element updates provide something valuable: very precise information about which input changes lead to which output changes. By lumping all updates together in a larger batch, we lose resolution on the effects of the changes. We have to dumb down the computation to get the performance benefits, and that sucks.

In this post, I'll explain the plan to fix this.

### A tale of three loops

Imagine you were asked to hand-write a program that gets provided with a timestamped sequence of edge changes (additions, deletions) and you need to provide the corresponding timestamped changes to the number of nodes at each distance from node zero.

That is, the input looks a bit like:

	 edge 	change 	 time
	(0,3)		+1		0
	(0,2)		+1		5
	(2,3)		+1	   10
	(0,3)       -1     11

and your output should look something like

	dist   change   time
	   1       +1      0
	   1       +1      5
	   1       -1     11
	   2       +1     11

where these counts are (I hope) the correct changes in counts for the distances in the graph. Let me know if they are not.

---

As an exercise, actually imagine this. How *would* you structure your hand-written program?

---

If I had to guess (and I do), I would guess that most people would write a program that foremost (i) iterates forward over timestamps, for each time (ii) iterates over distances from the root, and for each depth (iii) iterates over reachable nodes and their edges to determine the reachable set of the next depth.

That is, a program that looks roughly like

	foreach time 
		foreach depth (until converged)
			foreach node at depth
				set depth of neighbors to at most depth+1

This program seems totally fine, and I suspect a normal computer scientist will understand it better than the sort of loop we are going to end up with. To be totally clear, we aren't going to change the written program at all, we are just going to execute our program differently. But, if we had to write a program to explain how the execution works, it would look like this:

	foreach depth (until converged)
		foreach node at depth
			foreach time
				set depth of neighbors at time to at most depth+1

Oh geez. Why can't we just write normal programs for once, huh? 

Let's walk through the loop ordering above, using our example just above. Recall

	 edge 	change 	 time
	(0,3)		+1		0
	(0,2)		+1		5
	(2,3)		+1	   10
	(0,3)       -1     11

Now, we do "time" last, and we do iteration over depth first. So, that means that we start with the depth 0 nodes. As it turns out there is just one, the root (node `0`). We iterate over its edges, and determine which neighbors are reachable at which times, and offer them "depth 1". I think they are:

	(3,1)	    +1      0
	(2,1)       +1      5
	(3,1)       -1     11

This is all we do for the first depth. We are now ready to head in to the next depth, which is depth 1. These nodes (and their history) is highlighted just above. When we line this up with edges, we get proposals for depth 2:

	(3,2)       +1     10

Now, this proposal is mostly uninteresting to node `3`, except come time `11`. At that time, node `3` does actually end up with depth 2, and so we want to do another round of iteration. But, node `3` has no outgoing edges so there isn't anything to do.

Nothing in this execution required us to perform work in time order, except possibly within a `(depth, key)` pair. We could literally take the whole input history, if we had access to it, and compute the entire output history, doing the computation depth-by-depth.

This is possible only because we have chosen to map functional computations across input streams. This restriction on our computational model turns in to a flexibility in how we execute the computation. Isn't it just delightful when that happens?

### Why would we do this?

We can apparently pivot around iterative algorithms so that rather than time-by-time, we do rounds of iterations. Why would we do that?

There are a few reasons I can think of, and they kinda boil down to the same reason: the only sense in which data-parallel computation needs to wait on input times is that work should be done in-order for each key.

1.  **Each distinct timestamp is some serious overhead in timely dataflow.**

    This is really annoying. Each distinct timestamp results in all of the timely dataflow workers having a little chat. These chats can be boxcar'd together, but we are sending bytes of coordination traffic around for each distinct time. If there is one record for each time, we would be sending much more coordination traffic than data traffic. If we only need to send progress traffic for each iteration, rather than each (round, iteration), we cut out untenable overhead.

2.  **Workers can proceed independently on decoupled times, scaling better.**

    When we worry about times *last*, workers can get more done without having to coordinate. This means workers end up with larger hunks of work to perform before they need to wait on others, and generally higher utilization, and possibly higher throughput (we'll have to see).

3.  **Workers can re-order work across times to increase locality.**

    Even with a rich and complicated history of updates, workers can sort the entire collection by key and do only one scan of key-indexed state. For each key there may be many times to consider (in order!), but the worker only needs to visit each key once, and in whichever order is most convenient.

There might be a few other cool reasons. Each one is an opportunity for me to screw things up.

### Making this happen

What would it take to let us do this sort of transformation on iterative computations? Run batches of input changes concurrently, before we have finished all of the iterations of earlier batches? What black magic would we need to summon this pow

Actually, timely dataflow already does this.

Ok, ok. Let's remind ourselves about our reachability computation, which iteratively joins current distances with edges to propose new distances to each neighbor, followed by minimizing over the proposed distances for each node:

```rust
    // initialize roots as reaching themselves at distance 0
    let nodes = roots.map(|x| (x, 0));

    // repeatedly update minimal distances each node can be reached from each root
    nodes.iterate(|inner| {

        let edges = edges.enter(&inner.scope());
        let nodes = nodes.enter(&inner.scope());

        // propose dist+1 to neighbors, take mins.
        inner.join_map(&edges, |_k,l,d| (*d, l+1))
             .concat(&nodes)
             .group(|_, s, t| t.push((s[0].0, 1)))             
    })
```

Before we do anything, let's add one line after the `group`:

```rust
	.inspect_batch(|t,_| println!("time: {:?}", t))
```

This is going to tell us each time we see a batch of data produced by the `group` operator (the "min" on depths), and at what logical time we see it. It should clue us in to how the computation is actually being executed.

The code above is just the definition of the computation; we can run it a few different ways.

#### Way 1: One update at a time

Let's start with the traditional way we run these computations: we introduce a change to an input edge, adding a new edge and removing an old edge, and we then run the computation until the output reflects that change. In our timely code we might write something like:

```rust
for round in 0 .. rounds {
	// sliding window, let's pretend ...
	graph.send((edges[edge_count + round], 1));
	graph.send((edges[round], -1));

    // advance input and run.
    graph.advance_to(round + 1);
    computation.step_while(|| probe.lt(&graph.time()));
}
```

Here we push some changes into the computation, we advance the `graph` input (important!), and then we let the computation run until our `probe` (definition not shown) tells us that our output has caught up to the new input round.

Advancing the input is very important. This is what reveals to timely dataflow that there will be no more input data with whatever timestamps have been left behind, which is what allows it to pass this information along to differential dataflow operators. Then they get to go and do some work. 

Advancing is also what tells our `probe` that there can't be any more output. For homework, convince yourself that this version of the code doesn't work:

```rust
for round in 0 .. rounds {
    graph.advance_to(round);
	graph.send((edges[edge_count + round], 1));
	graph.send((edges[round], -1));
    computation.step_while(|| probe.le(&graph.time()));
}
```

Back to breadth-first search and depth computation. I'm going to run the computation one update at a time for ten rounds, on a graph with 100 nodes and 100 edges, like so:

    cargo run --example bfs -- 100 100 1 10

This produces a bunch of output times, each of the form `((Root, round), iteration)`:

	time: ((Root, 0), 0)
	time: ((Root, 0), 1)
	time: ((Root, 0), 2)
	time: ((Root, 0), 3)
	time: ((Root, 0), 4)
	time: ((Root, 2), 4)
	time: ((Root, 2), 5)
	time: ((Root, 5), 2)
	time: ((Root, 5), 3)
	time: ((Root, 7), 3)
	time: ((Root, 7), 4)
	time: ((Root, 9), 1)
	time: ((Root, 10), 3)
	time: ((Root, 10), 4)
	time: ((Root, 10), 5)
	time: ((Root, 10), 6)
	time: ((Root, 10), 7)
	time: ((Root, 10), 8)

As intended, we do all the work for one round before we proceed to the next round. Within each round, we perform work by iteration, as we kinda need to do one iteration before the next.

Actually, the *real* reason we do iterations in order is that timely dataflow sees that there is a back-edge in our dataflow graph, and that updates at `(round, iter)` can result in updates at `(round, iter+1)`. Timely dataflow does not give the go-ahead to differential dataflow operators until all of the work of the previous iteration has finished. That is why things actually happen in iteration order.

Notice that there is not a back edge from "previous rounds" to "subsequent rounds". Timely dataflow can see that updates at `(round, iter)` cannot result in updates at `(round+1, iter)`. What could the implications be ...

#### Way 2: Update all the things!

Let's let timely and differential off the leash. Instead of holding back on advancing the inputs, lets just put all the data in right away (but still at the correct rounds):

```rust
for round in 0 .. rounds {
	// sliding window, let's pretend ...
	graph.send((edges[edge_count + round], 1));
	graph.send((edges[round], -1));
    graph.advance_to(round + 1);
}

// run like crazy!
computation.step_while(|| probe.lt(&graph.time()));
```

This version of the code just dumps all the data in, and only once it is done does it go and start running the computation. At this point, timely knows that the input can't producing anything before `rounds`; what happens when differential sees this information?

	time: ((Root, 0), 0)
	time: ((Root, 0), 1)
	time: ((Root, 0), 2)
	time: ((Root, 5), 2)
	time: ((Root, 9), 1)  <-- wtf?
	time: ((Root, 0), 3)
	time: ((Root, 5), 3)
	time: ((Root, 7), 3)
	time: ((Root, 10), 3)
	time: ((Root, 0), 4)
	time: ((Root, 2), 4)
	time: ((Root, 7), 4)
	time: ((Root, 10), 4)
	time: ((Root, 2), 5)
	time: ((Root, 10), 5)
	time: ((Root, 10), 6)
	time: ((Root, 10), 7)
	time: ((Root, 10), 8)

Chew on that for a bit.

Actually, I think this all makes a lot of sense if you ignore the `(9,1)` for the moment. If you ignore that time, all of the other updates are done in iteration order. Timely and differential agree that we can do the work for each of the iteration `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5` at the same time, even before all work at prior rounds have completed.

The `(9,1)` update is a bit of a mystery, but nothing about differential dataflow's operator implementation guarantees that all work that can be performed will be performed *immediately*. In particular, there are several points where the operator learns it will need to do some more work, and enqueues the work rather than testing whether the work can be done right away. The apparent `(9,1)` disorder may just be a result of this. It's not an incorrect disorder, just work we could have done before `(0,2)` and `(5,2)` if we wanted to.

#### Way 3: A little bit of both

We could also do a bit of both: ingest some data, do some computation, ingest some data, do some computation. This is a lot more like what we actually expect in a streaming system. Taking all the timestamped input at once is more like a temporal database (as I understand them), and taking the timestamped input only one update at a time is like .. a bad streaming system I guess.

So let's do that, doing a few rounds (three) of computation after each update, but not necessarily running until all updates for the round are complete. What do we see:

	time: ((Root, 0), 0)
	time: ((Root, 0), 1)
	time: ((Root, 0), 2)
	time: ((Root, 0), 3)
	time: ((Root, 5), 2)
	time: ((Root, 0), 4)
	time: ((Root, 2), 4)
	time: ((Root, 5), 3)
	time: ((Root, 7), 3)
	time: ((Root, 2), 5)
	time: ((Root, 7), 4)
	time: ((Root, 9), 1)
	time: ((Root, 10), 3)
	time: ((Root, 10), 4)
	time: ((Root, 10), 5)
	time: ((Root, 10), 6)
	time: ((Root, 10), 7)
	time: ((Root, 10), 8)

This begins and ends pretty predictably, for obvious reasons (nothing to work on at beginning / end other than the first / last update). But in the middle we see some pretty neat stuff. I'm thinking specifically of

	...
	time: ((Root, 2), 5)
	time: ((Root, 7), 4)
	time: ((Root, 9), 1)
	...

Here we've got a neat little wave-front cutting through our `(round, iter)` partial order. Each of these times are mutually incomparable (none can lead to another), and they can all be processed concurrently.

### What needs to be different

If timely dataflow already lets us re-order the computation, and allows us to process multi-element wavefronts concurrently, what is the problem?

Although timely gives operators enough information, there are several implementation issues that emerge if we just let timely dataflow run free on fine-grained timestamps.

1.  **Each timestamp has lots of overhead**

    We already mentioned that timely does coordination for each timestamp, and that is still true a few sections later. If we want to avoid bogging down the computation with control traffic, we'll need to think of a better way of talking about all the different timestamps.

2.  **Differential operators run first by time, then by key**

    Even though timely informs the operators that they can re-order compuation by iteration rather than by round, within an operator the implementations still operate in blocks of logical time, rather than processing all available times for each key. We'll want to fix this (for sanity), but it also opens the door to improved locality (one pass over keys per invocation).

These two problems have relatively tractable solutions, which I'll just spill out there. Neither is properly implemented, but the first is in use in timely's logging infrastructure, and the second has been typed into comment out code. Pretty serious business. 

Honestly, the first step seems totally simple and workable, and I expect no issues. The second step will likely eventually work, but it risks discovering some horrible algorithmic nightmares along the way. That being said, here we go:

#### Step 1: High-resolution streams

Right now update streams in differential take the form of timely dataflow messages, where the data have the form 

```rust
	(record, diff): (D, isize)
```

There is some record, and a count indicating by how much it has changed. Like all timely dataflow messages, there is a time attached to the message, and we treat that as the time for all updates in the message. A timely dataflow message therefore looks something like (but is actually nothing like):

```rust
	(Time, Vec<(D, isize)>)
```

That is great if there are lots of updates with the same time, as they can get bundled together. This doesn't work especially well if, in the limit, there is just one update for each time. In addition to the control traffic, each update gets sent out as a singleton message with lots of associated overhead.

So, a different way of doing things, a more painful way if you don't actually need the flexibility, is to pack the times in as data as well, sending messages like

```rust
	(Time, Vec<(D, Time, isize)>)
```

We have `Time` in there twice now, but the two uses serve different roles. The first `Time` is timely dataflow's "capability". It tells timely dataflow, and us, at which logical times downstream operators are allowed to send data by virtue of holding on to this message. The second times tell us when changes *actually* occur, but these times don't need to be equal to that of the capability; timely dataflow doesn't know about them.

It turns out that for things to make sense, all of the second times should be greater or equal to that of the capability. If a change occurs, it may precipitate changes at that or future times, and we really want a capability that allows us to send messages reflecting those times. Correspondingly, we want timely dataflow's promise that "no messages with a given capability will arrive" to have meanining; the completion of a capability timestamp will imply the completion of the corresponding data timestamps.

So that's the plan. Bundle up batches of `(D, Time, isize)` updates and send them along with a capability that is less or equal to each of the times. Of course we can't just mint a capability out of nowhere, so it will really be the reverse: grab a capability and use it to send all the pending updates at times greater than or equal to its time. Once we've sent everything we need to, throw away the capability and let workers proceed to whatever bundles of times are next.

If we ever end up needing to send an update in the future of no capability we hold, we done screwed up.

#### Step 2: High-resolution operators

Operators currently receive timely dataflow messages of the first (time-free) form above, and receive progress information about the capabilities on those messages. We will need to rethink both of these, as well as the general structure of the operator's logic.

Informally, a differential dataflow operator accepts input updates into a pile, differentiated by timestamp. When it learns from its input that a timestamp in its pile is finished, it picks up all the updates with that timestamp and commits them. It then flips through all the keys in these committed updates, and checks whether the operator logic applied to the input collection at this time still produces the accumulated output at this time, and issues updates if not. 

Actually it is a bit more complicated, but let's not worry about that here.

The rough structure up above is time-by-time, but there is nothing much that prevents it from operating in terms of time *intervals* rather than individual times. You probably know what an interval is, right? Something like `[a, b)` that says "`a` and stuff up to but not including `b`".

We are going to do this, but where `a` and `b` are [antichains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain).

An antichain is a collection of mutually incomparable elements from a partial order, and in timely dataflow it acts a bit like a line cut across the partial order (not actually; that would be a [maximal antichain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain#Height_and_width)). We will speak of the interval `[a, b)` as those elements of the partial order greater or equal to some element of `a`, but not greater or equal to any element of `b`.

This may make more sense to think about an interval as those times that, from the point of view of a differential dataflow operator, were not previously complete (greater-or-equal to the prior input frontier) but are now complete (not greater-or-equal to the current input frontier). As an operator executes, the sequence of input frontiers it observes evolves, and each step defines an interval of this form.

With that thought in mind, our plan is to have each operator first identify the interval of newly completed times, say `[a,b)`, and then pull all updates with times in this interval. I don't know a great datastructure for this, so the working plan is that all `(D, Time, isize)` updates are just going to be in a big list that we scan each time the frontier changes. Once we pull out updates at newly completed times, we order them by key and process each key independently.

There are more details for sure, but once we are willing to just re-scan piles of updates in the name of performance, many doors are open to us.

#### Organization

I'm not sure I want to try and write operators that hybridize high-resolution and low-resolution implementations. At the moment I'm more inclined to specialize the `Collection` type, which wraps a stream of updates, into two types:

1. `LoResCollection`, which has relatively few distinct times, and bundles data without additional logical times as data.

2. `HiResCollection`, which has relatively many distinct times, and bundles logical times in with the data.

These two types can now have separate implementations of `group` and `join` and such. This does raise the question of what happens with `join` where the inputs are different granularities, and I don't know other than it is pretty easy to promote a `LoResCollection` to a `HiResCollection` just by sticking the same time in the payload. We could go the other way, but at an unboundedly horrible cost, so let's not.

Actually, the current `Trace` interface masks details about high-resolution vs low-resolution, and operators like `join` just take pre-arranged traces rather than weirdly typed `Collection` structs. It might be surprisingly non-horrible to meld the two representations together, for example supporting a frequently changing graph and an infrequently changing queries against it. I'm not sure how we would choose which output type to produce, though (the higher-resolution, of course, but how to determine this without specialization).

Related, we will evenutally want to meld high- and low-resolution trace representations. Quickly changing edge sets call for a high-resolution representation, but once the times have passed and we want to coalesce the updates, the resulting updates change only with iterations and not rounds, and admit a low-resolution representation. The low-resolution implementations can be much more efficient than the high-resolution ones, because they avoid some massive redundancy in re-transcribing the times with every update.

All in all, I think there are some great things to try out here, many likely pitfalls, but some fairly cool potential. I'm optimistic that we will soon get to a system that processes updates with high-resolution *and* high-throughput, for as long as you run the system. 

It will probably be slower on some batch graph compute, but are people really still working on that stuff?

### Addendum: A Prototype (March 5, 2017)

I have a prototype up and running. It seems to produce the correct output, in the sense that it produces exactly the same outputs whether you run it with one update at a time, or one million updates at a time. Also, the output isn't empty; I though to check that.

First up, let's look at some measurements from the previous pile of code. This pile is designed to take batches of records which all have the same time. This means that if you want each update to have its own timestamp, you get lots of small batches. If you put multiple updates together in a batch, they all have the same timestamp and their effects can't be distinguished.

Using this implementation, let's get some baseline measurements. We are going to look at doing one million updates to two random graphs, one with 1,000 nodes and 2,000 edges, and one with 1,000,000 nodes and 10,000,000 edges. We will do the one million updates a few different ways, batching the updates in batches of sizes from one up to one million (e.g. `10 x 100000` means batches of size 10, 100,000 times). All updates in a batch have the same timestamp.

|  experiment | 1k / 2k | 1m / 10m |
|------------:|--------:|---------:|
| 1 x 1000000 |    142s |     100s | 
| 10 x 100000 |     73s |      64s |
| 100 x 10000 |     27s |      51s |
| 1000 x 1000 |      5s |      48s |
| 10000 x 100 |       - |      34s |
| 100000 x 10 |       - |      21s |
| 1000000 x 1 |       - |      12s |

We don't have measurements for 10,000 and larger batch sizes for the small graph, because with only 2,000 edges and the same timestamp for all the updates, most of the changes would just cancel. I should say, although it is trivial for the `1k / 2k` graph, the `1m / 10m` graph takes about eight seconds to load its ten million edges, and these numbers include that.

Notice the massive discrepancy between single-element batches (142s and 100s) and the larger batches (5s and 12s). This is a pretty substantial throughput difference. We would love to get that throughput, or something close to it, while keeping the resolution of single-element updates.

#### The prototype

There is some prototype code! Yay! It is *pretty weird* code, not like much I've written before. I'm quite certain there are inefficiencies in it, so the absolute numbers are just and indication that we are moving in the right direction. These are the same experiments as above, except here *every update has a distinct timestamp*. We are producing the output that corresponds to the `1 x 1000000` row from above, but without shattering all the updates into different batches.

|  experiment | 1k / 2k | 1m / 10m |
|------------:|--------:|---------:|
| 1 x 1000000 |       - |        - | 
| 10 x 100000 |    237s |      94s |
| 100 x 10000 |    173s |      75s |
| 1000 x 1000 |    148s |      57s |
| 10000 x 100 |    623s |      43s |
| 100000 x 10 |       - |      31s |
| 1000000 x 1 |       - |      25s |

There are several things different about this chart. 

1. First up, you may notice we didn't do a batch size 1 row. There are some things we do assuming there will be lots of work, and when there isn't lots of work we do it anyhow; this will probably be fixed. These same issues end up hurting the small graph more than the large graph; the small graph is sparser, and updates cause longer cascades of small updates. 

2. We have a `10000 x 100` entry for the smaller graph! It makes sense to run the experiment now, because each update with a different time doesn't result in cancelation. Unfortunately, it is terrible. The reason here seems to be the same reason we had to do that [compaction](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2017-02-11.md) stuff: with so many updates, each of the 1,000 keys gets a sizeable history, and within a batch we are trying to process all of it without compacting it. The good news is that we should be to do compaction on our own. The bad news is that I have to code that up.

3. The `1m / 10m` column doesn't look so bad, does it? The times are worse than before, for sure, but not by all that much. They are roughly "one batch size worse", I think. And the results tell us the exact consequences of each individual update, corresponding to the `1 x 1000000` row up above. I think these could also get a bit better, because there are some fairly feeble moments in the code.

Let's take the `1m / 10m` experiment and crank up the number of workers. Note: we are still producing the high-resolution outputs.

|  experiment | 1 worker | 2 workers |
|------------:|---------:|----------:|
| 1 x 1000000 |        - |         - |
| 10 x 100000 |      94s |       82s |
| 100 x 10000 |      75s |       58s |
| 1000 x 1000 |      57s |       39s |
| 10000 x 100 |      43s |       28s |
| 100000 x 10 |      31s |       20s |
| 1000000 x 1 |      25s |       15s |

Here, one worker takes 8s before it starts processing updates, and two workers take 5s before they start processing updates. These numbers include those two (and look a bit better if you mentally subtract that out).

This is pretty good news, I think. For small batches the second worker doesn't help much, which is what we should expect; the high-resolution changes don't improve the performance of small batches, they make larger batches produce the same output. The larger batches do get a decent benefit from additional workers; the scaling isn't 2x, and it probably shouldn't be (we have to do data exchange, and flail around with some buffers).

This looks pretty promising to me. We can get the output that used to take us 92s (100s - 8s) now in just 10s to 15s. Or, maybe 23s if we want sub-second response time. See, we need to take the total time and divide by the number of batches to get the average response time, and we only get 1m updates / 10s throughput if we want to wait for 10s. In fact, if that is our strategy there are going to be some updates that take 20s before we see their implications. We'd really like to draw down the numbers for the medium batch sizes.

There are for sure things to improve in the code, and I hope and expect these numbers to come down. I'm also worried about (and planning on fixing) the numbers for the smaller graph, which I'd very much like to work hitch-free. In particular, I'd love to have an "idiot-proof" implementation that just works for any reasonable problem, without careful caveats about settings of batch sizes and the like. Watch this space!
