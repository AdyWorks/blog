Today we are going to look at something that I think is pretty amazing. I've wanted to do this for a while, and while at ETH Zürich I found the time and collaborators ([John Liagouris](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/ioannisl/) and [Zaheer Chothia](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/zchothia/)) to make it happen.

We are probably all familiar with "big data": for some reason you have been gifted with a pile of data so large that you couldn't hope to do anything with it other than download some scalable system, describe some thoughtful computation, and press "GO". Of course, there are many flavors of these computations, and the one we'll be working with is "high-throughput", "low-latency", and allows you to write nice iterative computations: [differential dataflow](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow). But really, what we are about to do isn't system dependent: you should be able to do this with any sufficiently powerful system; we'll just use a specific sufficiently powerful one.

So. You went and wrote a big data computation, you pressed "GO", and depending on your system you are now either waiting, or perhaps watching a stream of results. Look at all those answers coming out! How did they get there? Imagine picking up any one output and asking "why this result, and not another?". Your social network analysis tells you who can reach whom, but how can you explain the result as anything other than "my computation applied to a terabyte of data"?

We're going to look today at the problem of *explaining outputs*. For all of the exciting and meaningful results you computed, how can individual result elements be explained in terms of inputs to the computation? What does that even mean?

We have a [tech report](http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/view/eth:48721) online, in case you are the sort of person who prefers that type of reading. It has more details and fewer flip comments.

### Explaining reachability

Let's take a simple example from above: determining the connected components of a social graph like the Twitter @mention relationship. Maybe once we have computed the results we need to explain some things. Maybe we want to know how to get two connected people in touch, or explain why you are so well connected to Justin Bieber, or debug a logical inconsistency in the data (e.g. "there should be no path from A to B; what's up?").

We've [seen before](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-05-12.md#graph-connectivity) how to perform a reachability computation: individuals propose labels to their neighbors, and each remembers (and re-proposes) the smallest label it has ever seen. In the fullness of time, any two people who can reach each other will eventually have the same label. The results of this computation are pairs `(person, label)`, where two people with the same label can reach one another.

Imagine we run the computation and see among our outputs `(frank, label)`. You might want to know why; what part of the input leads the computation to produce this particular result? How did I get that label?

If you are familiar with the algorithm, there is a fairly simple answer: `label` traverses a sequence of graph edges to get to `frank`. This sequence of edges is just a path in the graph, and is a great explanation for why we see this result: the output is concise, and it has the property that if we re-run the computation on just this input (the path) we get `(frank, label)` in the output.

Consider the following two ways of looking at your data: with all the data, and with only input elements that explain the output:

![example](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/example.png)

Explanations look like they might be pretty handy for reachability, right?

I mean, we would still have to write a weird system for finding paths in the graph, and do more bespoke work if you ever want to change your query (e.g. maybe you decide wait for a second copy of the label, making the explanations be "two paths", or something weird like that). But at least we understand what an explanation kinda looks like, right?

### Explaining all the things

What we will work through today is a framework for explaining the outputs of *any* differential dataflow computation, using differential dataflow itself. This means that we'll end up with computations that can be interactively interrogated to get output explanations, and these explanations update in realtime as the explanatory inputs change. If the paths from `label` to `frank` change, we will observe the stream of these changes (and if the label for `frank` changes, we will see the paths swing to connect to the new label).

So we automatically get interactive explanations for arbitrary outputs of any computation, in realtime. What isn't to like? Well, there are some overheads, and we will see these, but I'm glad to have your attention.

## Explanations

Before going too far, let's specify the problem we would like to solve. Imagine we have an input collection, a computation, and a corresponding output collection. For any subset of the output domain, we want to identify a subset of the input collection whose output under the computation agrees with the actual output, on the specified subset. This was a bit wordy, because we want to be able to explain not only output records, but the *absence* of output records. For some set of records that may or may not exist, we want a subset of the input that faithfully reproduces what actually happened for those records. Even if this means *preventing* some records from being produced.

We know there is at least one solution to this problem: the entire input collection itself reproduces the entire output collection. However, we are interested in more concise explanations, and will work towards minimizing the amount of input we actually need. This is one place where differential dataflow helps out a great deal: naïve adaptations of existing work can result in enormous explanations. Even differential dataflow can provide large explanations, and we will need to introduce some "optimizations" to streamline the explanations. For example, we may just want *one* path between two nodes, rather than all paths, or ever "all shortest paths".

We promised interactive updates to explanations for interactively update computations, so let's clear that up now. 

Recall that differential dataflow updates computations. We will produce explanations in the spirit above, using differential dataflow. As such, that computation (the explanation computation) will interactively update as well. At each moment in time, we will have computed an explanation for the current snapshot of the data, where the stream of updates to the explanations move us from one correct answer (explanation) to the next, tracking the changes to the input.

## Differential dataflow

Let's do a quick recap of what differential dataflow is, because this will play an important role in understanding how it plays a role in explaning things. We could just start with the idea that it is good at doing big-data like computations, and that it quickly updates computations. This is a great start, but we'll want to dig a bit deeper to really grok what is going on.

Differential dataflow computations can be viewed as directed dataflow computations: each vertex in the dataflow graph names a collection, and directed edges from one vertex to another indicate that the source is used in the definition of the target. 

For example, here is a picture (it is for breadth-first search, but the graph structure is basically the same for label propagation):

![dataflow](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/dataflow.png)

This structure has several important consequences:

### Functional operators

Each differential dataflow collection is defined *only* by its inputs, which is an important part of explaining the collection.

> A collection is explained by the collections that are its dataflow inputs.

This isn't very helpful yet, because we have identified entire collections as useful for explaining outputs. If we just report that you pretty much need all the data, you wouldn't be too impressed.

Fortunately, most big data computations (and differential dataflow specifically) use *data-parallel* operators: each collection is not an arbitrary function of its inputs, but rather the result of partitioning the elements of its input collections, and applying a function to each part. For example, when we determine the minimum label a graph node receives, we partition the proposed labels by "proposee"; at this point, each part yields only the smallest label, independent of what the other parts do.

This independence is part of what makes differential dataflow go fast: we know that changes only affect one part, and can minimize the amount of recomputation we do when a change arrives. For exactly the same reason, indepedence helps us provide concise explanations: we know that only so many records played a role in determining some output.

> A collection element is explained by the input collection elements in the part that would produce it.

This is now a bit more helpful. If we need to explain some records in the output of an operator, we just need to look up the inputs to the corresponding parts. They do a good job explaining the output.

### Dataflow structure

While each operator can name input records required to explain output records, the dataflow graph shows us how to find explanations for these input records: they were output records of some other vertex in the dataflow graph, or perhaps they are inputs to the computation itself. In either case, we can chase backwards through the dataflow graph, expanding the set of tuples of which we require explanations, until we have some subset of the input records and no additional internal records to explain.

Looking back at the picture up above; if we had to explain the outputs of `group`, we would push them back to `concat`, which would probably require explanations from `map`, etc. 

There is the sneaky issue that differential dataflow allows loops, which means we might have to chase these dependencies for a while. This is true, but we'll use differential dataflow's timestamps (in the next section) to make sure that we only chase *causal* dependencies: records that could actually play a role in the production of outputs. 

### Logical timestamps

Differential dataflow transcribes evolving collections as an append-only log of changes to the collection. The collection might initially have some records `r1, r2, r3` in it, but as the computation proceeds perhaps `r1` departs (for reasons unknown). This would be recorded by differential dataflow as something like:

    (r1, +1, 0)
    (r2, +1, 0)
    (r3, +1, 0)
    (r1, -1, 7)

where the shape of these tuples is `(record, change, time)`: the record has some change to the number of times it occurs in the collection, where the changes occur at some logical time. Here we've had the first three changes take effect immediately (at time `0`), with the removal of `r1` at time `7`, which I just made up arbitrarily.

Each differential dataflow operator maps whatever collection logic it has across all of the times at which its inputs change. For the example above, it could produce output changes at times `0` and `7`. Importantly, the computation for time `0` ignores the input changes for time `7` (or other times greater than `0`); consequently, they will not play a role in explaining such outputs.

The important feature here is the timestamp: when we explain records in a differential dataflow computation, we will ask for explanations *at a specific timestamp*. For example, if we want to know about `r1`, we need to clearly indicate whether we want it explained at time `0`, when the record still exists, or at time `7`, when it no longer exists. In the first case, we can ignore the `(r1, -1, 7)` tuple; it doesn't explain the output, and we don't need to have it explained. In the second case, we totally need that subtraction, because without it we wouldn't produce the right answer (and you wouldn't be impressed with the explanation). 

Timestamps also allow us to break "explanation loops" that might otherwise exist in chasing records around a cyclic dataflow graph: here we guarantee that the explanatory timestamps only decrease as we chase them through the dataflow graph.

## Mocking up explanations

We are going to start with a very simple approach: for each differential dataflow operator, we'll make a second, new operator with the same behavior, but additional inputs and outputs. For each output of the original operator, we'll add a new "explain me" input: this input sees a collection of operator outputs that should be explained. For each input of the original operator, we'll add a new "explanation" output: this output produces the subset of the corresponding input needed to explain the requested outputs. Because the figures work this way, we'll add the suffix `_q` to these new "query" collections.

We'll then wire up our new operators in a reflection of the original dataflow graph: wherever there is an edge from `op1` to `op2`, we will add an edge in the reverse direction, from `op2_q` back to `op1_q`. This will turn explanation requests made of `op2` into explanation requests for `op1`, which in turn can pass requests back to its input operators. For timely dataflow nerds, these new operators will live in a second scope, parallel to the original. This indicates to timely that information only flows in one direction, from our computation to the explanation infrastructure, and not back; this prevents explanation work from blocking actual computation.

![reflected](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/reflected.png)

This simple approach should make our approach clear (I hope), but we'll want to move on to some smarter versions to streamline the computation. We will do that just afterwards, so if it all seems hopelessly naïve don't worry (at least, not yet). We'll also need to add a bit more complexity to deal with a big secret I haven't mentioned yet.

### A simple approach (`group`)

The simplest sort of operator in differential dataflow is the `group` operator, which allows you to specify a key for each input record, and some logic to apply to each group of records (grouped by that key). The output collection is the collation of all of the outputs produced by the groups.

We are going to make our lives a little easier here, and require that the outputs from `group` have the form `(key, val)`; that is, they explicitly record the key used to produce the record. We could work around this by keeping a bit more information on the side, but we'll see that most of use cases do this, and it is basically free to "discard" the key if we actually want to. 

So we have input records that look like `(key, val)` and output records that look like `(key, val)`, and for any requested output records we want to find the input records with the same key (because those are exactly the inputs that produced the output). It kind of looks like we want a `join` between the actual input and the requested output. Let's do that.

![group](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/group.png)

This is a really simple way to fish out the relevant inputs for any given outputs. At least, it is a simple way to describe it; what are the overheads involved?

A `join` in differential dataflow is roughly like a hash-join: each input is kept indexed by its key, and when records (changes to records) arrive on either input they are matched against existing records on the other input. In our case, the input collection will be maintained indexed by key, and as new requests arrive they result in one look-up, and the emission of input records with the same key.

This approach maintains a second copy of the input data, indexed by key. That can be a fair amount of space. At run-time, lookups for explanations are relatively cheap; the work done is proportional to the amount of explanations required, which is probably as good as it gets.

If we wanted to be smarter, we could try and re-use the index `group` itself uses (it indexes the same input data, and in the same way). You can actually do this in differential today, though this is a new feature and we didn't use it when we did the work.

### A simple approach (`map`)

The other operator we need to get a primitive MapReduce computation up is `map`, which allows you to take each input record to a collection of output records, with no requirements on how you do it. In principle it is easy to explain this operator, because each output record comes from some specific input record. In practice, you have to just write down all these pairs, which is easy but annoying. We will improve it, but for now the picture looks like this:

![map](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/map.png)

The `join` here is like the one for `group`, but there are probably a lot more keys here. Plus, we expected to do a fair bit of work when we wrote `group`, but we probably thought `map` would be cheap. We'll fix this up in some special cases in the smarter variants.

### Smarter approaches

These are going to be some smarter approaches, but also some admissions that what was done above wasn't sufficient. For example, we don't really treat binary operators above (you could generalize the approach without much work), and we haven't dealt with "keyless" operators like `map` which can be expensive without the key structure. Maybe think of this section as making you smarter, rather than us being smart.

#### The `map` operator

Explanations for `map` can be simplified dramatically when the map logic is *invertible*. That is, if we can go automatically from the output to the input, then we don't need to write anything down. You might think this is a rare case, but in our examples at least we use `map` mostly to re-arrange a record to exchange which parts are key and which parts are value. 

In case it isn't clear, we have a picture indicating the smarter dataflow:

![invert](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/invert.png)

#### The `join` operator

The `join` operator takes two collections `(key, val1)` and `(key, val2)` and produces pairs `(key, (val1, val2))` when it finds a matching pair. Requesting an explanation for `(key, (val1, val2))` ends up being very easy, as we have all the information about what we need in front of us. We just request an explanation for `(key, val1)` from the first input and `(key, val2)` for the second input.

![join](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/join.png)

No additional state needs to be retained for `join` operators. At runtime, each explanation request just turns into one explanation request for each of the inputs to the join.

#### The `topk` operator

The `group` operator is a general-purpose aggregator, but often we know there is more specific logic to be applied. One example we saw several times in our programs is the `topk` operator, which partitions its input by some key and for each key retains the top few values in the part.

For example, label propagation repeatedly circulates label proposals, with each participant retaining only the smallest label. We would usually write this with a `group` operator, because we want to bring together all the proposals destined for one participant. We know that we only plan to keep the smallest label, but as long as this remains our secret any general-purpose explanation infrastructure will only know to ask for explanations of all of a parts input. 

Instead, if we make clear that we are using a special form of `group`, we should be able to ask for the smallest record (or records) as the explanation. These records explains what actually happens, as all other records are simply discarded. To make this work correctly, we need to join any requests `(key, val)` with the actual top records, because it may differ from the request; recall that we want to explain absences as well as actual records (why was that again? keep reading!).

![topk](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/topk.png)

The overhead of `topk` is like that of `group`, except that we index the output of the operator rather than its input. This can be substantially smaller, especially if the `topk` reduces the data a lot. At runtime, each explanation request turns in to one lookup, like with `group`, but probably produces fewer explanation requests of the operator's inputs.

### Recap

When we write a differential dataflow program, we also assemble a shadow copy of the dataflow graph, one that draws in various collections produced by the real computation, as well as requests for explanations of its output records. This shadow dataflow graph circulates explanation requests until all have resolved requests made of the input collections themselves. These inputs are then the explanations for the outputs. 

This sounds great, and we are going to look at how well it works on the graph connectivity problem. Then we will talk a bit about how it doesn't actually work as promised, we'll fix it, and then we'll move to a more awesome problem (stable matching).

## Explaining reachability

We are going to take some "real" graphs, a Livejournal linkage graph and a Twitter follower graph, spin up a graph reachability computation, and start asking for explanations about their outputs. These datasets are both static, so we will fake out some changes when it comes time to see how responsive the computations are.

### Baseline approaches

There aren't a lot of techniques for automatically explaining iterative computations. Believe me when I say it was hard enough just finding systems that produce the correct answers in the first place. There are two strawman implementations we could consider, but don't take these as critiques of their associated systems; neither were designed for this.

#### Spark-style provenance

If you think of our iterative computations as repeated batch computation, you could apply some existing work on data provenance to determine, for each iteration, which input tuples play a role in producing each output tuple. The reasoning we did for `group` isn't new, and you can just apply it on an operator by operator basis.

If you try this, you pretty quickly run aground on a few issues. First, Spark isn't great at iterative computations in the first place, even without explaining its outputs. Second, and more importantly, in each iteration the labels for each node get updated based on new proposals and old values. Nothing in the computation reveals that "staying put" doesn't require an explanation. If a label hasn't changed, don't bother tracking down the explanations for all those pointless proposals, right? If you require explanations for these pointless proposals, you are going to bring in the edges the traversed, transitively, which ends up being all the edges in the connected component.

The computational model doesn't reveal the relation between successive iterates, which is what lets differential dataflow determine it only needs explanations for times less or equal to those of requests.

#### Datalog-style provenance

Another approach is to invoke provenance work done in the datalog community. If you aren't familiar with datalog, think of it as a version of SQL with recursion and a less shouty syntax. The language inherently supports recursion and joins, which is great for label propagation, but it doesn't natively support aggregations like `min`/`topk`. Also, for good reasons, the explanations produced in these systems include *all* explanations, corresponding to all paths from `label` to `frank` in our example from way above. 

This isn't as bad as the Spark-style "literally every path anywhere" explanations, but in a connected graph you are still going to get all the edges in your connected component. You'll produce fewer intermediate requests though, so yay.

Both of these approach end up asking for pretty much all the edges in the graph. This isn't helpful. We aren't going to evaluate these. 

### Simple differential approach

We'll start with a simple differential dataflow approach, based on a direct port of the connected component code in the differential dataflow repository. This code uses a `group` to collect the labels each iteration. The differential computation does reveal that it is the same collection changing each iteration, which allows differential to isolate the first time a label (e.g. `(frank, label)`) appears, and stop talking about it afterwards. On the other hand, this simple version isn't bright enough to use the `topk` instead of `group`, and that has some performance issues we will check out.

Our plan is to load up the Twitter data, as a batch computation but with the potential to update the edges if we like, and then start asking for explanations of random observed outputs. We'll get our answers, but the amount of time taken for the responses may (will) vary. Let's look at that.

![times](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/cc-nomin-twitter-latency.png)

Ok, let's explain this figure. We did this measurement 1,000 times, recording the time taken for each, and we are plotting the distribution of these 1,000 measurements in this figure. Basically, we sort the values and plot them, and that gives the empirical complementary cumulative density function, or something.

What the figure tells us is that we most take at least one second, and we get as large as one thousand seconds (though not so often). That doesn't sound brilliant, does it?

The explanation lies in the next figure, in which we plot the time taken against the *size* of the explanation:

![sizes](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/cc-nomin-twitter-times-changes.png)

This is just a scatterplot, but it shows us that there is a pretty serious correlation between the amount of time taken and the size of the explanation. And, wtf why are the explanations so big so often? Some are nearly one million edges. That sounds wrong, right?

The problem here is that `group` is just pulling in all contributions to each computation. This is actually pretty decent, in that if you get label `0` in round 5, `group` is smart enough to only ask for inputs in round `4`, and then round `3` etc. Because the differential dataflow label propagation is smart (it propagates small labels first), this actually means that we are producing edges corresponding to shortest paths from, e.g. `label` to `frank`. 

The problem is that there can be lots of these shortest paths. Many nodes have large numbers (hundreds of thousands) of paths of the same short length back to the node that produced their label. The `group` operator keeps all of them, because ... well.

So at least part of the problem is that we are producing too much output. Not just that there are 1M records to work with (that doesn't take 1,000 seconds), but all the weird chasing around of data and looking things up, it's just a mess with such casual explanations.

### Smarter differential approach

Let's swing in the `topk` operator, which is smarter than `group` and only requires one element (label proposal, in this case) as an explanation. As everyone is actually proposing the same label in the example above, what this actually produces as an explanation is the shortest path along the smallest node identifiers. Kind of weird, but it makes for a unique explanation where otherwise there would be many. 

Let's look at the latency plot. We took this one with multiple workers, because... science.

![times](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/cc-twitter-true.png)

These numbers look a lot better. We are well below one second, and typically down around 10-100ms, depending on the number of workers we use. The fewer workers the better, right? It makes sense because there is very little parallel work to do here, but the throughput of the actual system would (does) suffer if we don't use multiple workers. The 32 worker numbers look a bit dodgy, in part because this is the number of cores the machine has, and if anything else needs to run the measurements get screwed up.

We also took some measurements where we update the graph to see how those latencies are affected. 

![updates](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/cc-twitter-update-noprov-10.png)

They basically tell us that updates are still millisecond or less, except for some idiot measurement out in the tail that spiked to 1,000 seconds. No clue there; we think it is start-up, but didn't want to just delete the measurement (again, science).

### Overheads

What about overheads? Like, how much are we paying extra when we turn on this explanation infrastructure? Yeah, some. Actually a fair bit. We ran the computation with and without explanations, with various numbers of workers, and compared it to Myria, a recent big data system that does graph connectivity. We tried to use SociaLite but it didn't produce the right answers, and GraphX doesn't run on the resources we used (one machine). 

![overhead](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/cc-overhead-twitter.png)

There is overhead, and it is non-trivial, but we still end up going faster than other systems. So, "boo overhead" and "yay differential dataflow". Possibly also "boo not giving Myria a fair shot because we don't understand it". Call me.

The overheads are mostly due to the fact that the reference differential computation is pretty lean. All of the internal indices it uses are keyed by dense unsigned integers, and just use direct indexing into arrays. Some of the explanation operators require indices keyed by pairs, and fall back to a much slower `HashMap` implementation. 

### Recap. 

These numbers are great. Zoom. Pow! 

There was something about how it doesn't work, wasn't there?

## Grown-up time

The label propagation example works just fine. But it is a special case of computation that everyone seems to fixate on, called a *monotonic* computation. If you add more inputs to such a computation, you just get more (or better) outputs. Additional inputs don't *suppress* output records.

It turns out if you are dealing with non-monotonic computations, which means you aren't doing label propagation, you aren't doing SQL or Datalog, and you quite probably aren't using research systems (most of which don't handle non-monotonic operators), the explanations we produce don't necessarily explain the results.

Although we did a great job of finding inputs that played a role in producing your outputs, they may not have the property that if you re-run your computation on them you actually get the output. That would suck, right? But it happens.

### Stable matching

To get a sense for what goes wrong, let's look at another cool algorithm that differential dataflow supports: stable matching.

Stable matching is a problem where you have a bipartite graph, so some nodes are blue and some are red, and each node has some preferences for some of the nodes of the other color, which we indicate by an edge with some preference on it (small values are better). The idea is to find a matching, a subset of these edges, so that no blue and red node would prefer to ditch their current assignment and hook-up with each other.

There are a bunch of algorithms for this problem, but there is a really simple one which proceeds in rounds, where each blue node proposes to its most prefered red node that hasn't yet rejected it. Red nodes then look at their proposals and go with whichever is best, walking away from proposals in the last round if they've gotten something better. 

Grumpy people might say this requires a lot of nerve on the part of the blue nodes, and is bad behavior on the part of the red nodes, but you can prove that the process ends up with blue-optimal and red-pessimal assignments, so stfu and put yourself out there.

Anyhow, let's write the algorithm in differential dataflow, starting from a collection of quadruples

    (name_1, pref_1, name_2, pref_2)

The algorithm repeatedly thins out these possible assignments by proposing the best ones, and discarding any that are rejected:

    initial.iterate(|active| {
      // key records by a, order by pa.
      let props =
        active.map(|x| (x.a,(x.pa,x.b,x.pb)))
              .topk(1, |x| x);

      // key records by b, order by pb.
      let accpt =
        props.map(|x| (x.b,(x.pb,x.a,x.pa)))
             .topk(1, |x| x);

      // discard unaccepted proposals.
      active.except(props.except(accpt))
  })

We just do a `topk` to get each of the best blue proposals, followed by another `topk` using a different key (the proposed at). The process terminates when there are no remaining options for unmatched nodes.

### Explaining matchings

Let's say we run the computation and we see in the output 

    (frank, mr_scruffles)

Ok, how did that happen? I had lots of people on my list, and put `mr_scruffles` at the end as a joke. If we use our explanation infrastructure, we discover as an explanation (trust me on this) my full list of preferences that I went through, and the preferences for `mr_scruffles`, which he must have keyed in with his cute, furry paws. What we don't see is a good explanation for why everyone else on my list told me to take a hike. 

The problem here is that no one actually told me to take a hike. There is no positive data for rejection here. The computation knows that if it doesn't receive a response, it should cross off the proposal. This is the right thing to do, but it baffles the explanation infrastructure, which thought that if it got all the input data it would produce the right output. Nope. There are some *absences* that are just as important (specifically, from the `accpt` collection).

Although part of the problem here is that we need to explain the absence of records, we know how to do that (at least, the infrastructure already does that). The bigger problem is that we don't know that we need to explain the absence of a record until we run the computation forward and fail to get the right answer. We can just request an explanation for every absent record, because, well most of them are absent. Like, infinitely many.

So if we just take my preference list and that of `mr_scruffles`, and we run the computation forward, we get the tuples

	(frank, **REDACTED**)
	(frank's_leg, mr_scruffles)

because these were the top preferences for `frank` and `mr_scruffles`, respectively, and the other involved parties have no better options that we identified. This isn't the right answer, though.

Of course, **REDACTED** had better proposals (perhaps so did `frank's_leg), and those other proposals are an important part of explaining this unfortunate incident.

### Fixing things

There is a relatively simple way to fix things, and amazingly it actually works (in differential). We are going to do a few things, which I will enumerate:

1. We instantiate a second copy of the computation (here: "stable matching") whose input will be the explanation we identify. We use this second copy to try out our explanation and look for issues.
2. We merge the outputs of these second copies of operators with those of the reference computation, feeding into the explanation infrastructure. If it outputs the same records as in the reference computation, great. If it outputs BS records that don't exist in the reference computation, those records must be explained. They don't exist, so their "explanation" will correct their existence. 
3. This may happen multiple times, so we run this process to fixed point, adding (never removing) records to the explanation until the BS records are cleaned up. 

Yeah, it is a bit crazy having all these additional loops around. It works because math. Math says "you're welcome".

All those numbers you saw up above for reachability were using this weird infrastructure. Differential means it has approximately zero overhead when you don't need it (i.e. no iterations required).

### Stable matching experiments

With things fixed, let's start looking at some stable matching numbers. You don't see lots of stable matching in papers, partly because as a non-monotonic computation there are a bunch of cheats you can't do. Asynchronous computation doesn't work as well with non-monotonic logic, and it isn't a super clean "think like a vertex" program. Point being, I don't actually know what good numbers should be, but we will see what they are.

The Twitter graph ends up being a bit of a pain here. We put random preferences on each edge, but because some nodes have degrees in the millions, we see some stupidly large explanations. To make our lives easier, we threw away vertices with degree greater than 1,000. We didn't do this with the Livejournal dataset, so you can check out those numbers if you are keen.

We did a query latency experiment where we picked random outputs from the computation and asked to have them explained.

You can see that some hunk of the examples require just a few milliseconds. I'm guessing these are folks that didn't have lots of choices, and require no iteration to sort out why they got what they got. We do see a tail where some explanations require up to 10s to figure out. 

Like with the naïve connected components, much of this comes down to complicated explanations. We know that there are short paths and that this should mean small explanations for reachability, but we really have no good intuition about what explanations for matchings should look like. Here is a scatterplot of the times versus sizes of explanation

![sizes](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/twitter-times-changes.png)

Some of the explanations are big, but not so big. What is going on? Let's do the same scatterplot, but with number of rounds of derivation rather than size of explanation.

![rounds](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/assets/provenance/twitter-times-rounds.png)

The explanations aren't very big, but they do require many rounds to sort out. With random preferences, it is really easy to have a cascade of new work whenever a previously accepted proposal is declined. The next proposal on the list may be the best thing in the world for the recipient, and everything gets shaken up. I anticipate you'd see a lot less of this if there were some background ordering that most of the lists reflected.

In any case, most of the explanations come back with sub-second latency, so you might still call them interactive. They don't screw up the update latency either, so I can maintain a continually updated view of the many reasons I am at home with `mr_scruffles` tonight.
